# [Relicstaurants] [build badges go here when available]

> The Relicstaurants repository was created so that you can test New Relic observability on a small but real project. You don't have to create a special application just to practice, we did it for you. So go ahead and copy the repository, run it locally and try to implement observability for this project yourself. You can find a tip on what the finished project looks like on the "observability" branch
